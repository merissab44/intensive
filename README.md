# intensive

Welcome to Lashed By Lani!!

For my intensive project I decided to create a website to assist one of my closest friends with her new business! 

I wanted to create something that will help her brand stand out and that helped me come up with her color theme/palette for her website. 

I also wanted her to not have to go through social media for her business because while it can help you build a client base, it's hard to keep 

track of all the differnet appointments and having to constantly explain prices, procedures etc.
